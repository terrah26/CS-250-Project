How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs, research is conducted by interviews, surveys, and observations. The data then needs to be analyzed to create user personas to find your target audience. User stories help define what the users want and why.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To develop programs, you need to understand the requirements thoroughly. Then plan and prioriitize the backlog, and create user stories. Next, test cases should be made from the user stories. Next, integrate code and continue to test the software for a final error-free product. The Agile process I would like to incorporate into my future development work is Scrum roles and Sprints.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member has great problem solving skills, a willingness to learn new ideas and stay updated with the latest trends, and works effectively with the team. A team member should be accountable for their own work and decisions.
